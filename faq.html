  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <h2>What is RV Tech Weigh & Inspect?</h2>
  <p>We are mobile RV Techs, we offer four-corner RV weighing and Inspection services that come to you.</p>

  <h2>Why should I weigh my RV?</h2>
  <p>Knowing your RV’s weight helps prevent tire failures, suspension issues, and unsafe loading. It ensures safe and confident travel.</p>

  <h2>Do I need an appointment?</h2>
  <p>Yes, scheduling helps us provide timely service at your location. Contact us to set up a convenient time.</p>

  <h2>How is the RV weighed?</h2>
  <p>Each wheel is weighed individually using professional scales, and a detailed report is provided to you with guidance on load balancing and safety tips.</p>
<h2>Why should I have my RV weighed?</h2>
<p>To know if your RV exceeds the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) or Gross Axle Weight Ratings (GAWR). Exceeding these ratings can cause premature wear, repairs, or safety hazards. It also helps determine if your motorhome or towable combination exceeds the Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR) and if special licensing is required. Finally, it ensures your RV tires are properly loaded and inflated.</p>

<h2>Why should I have my RV weighed by wheel position?</h2>
<p>Wheel-by-wheel weighing is the only way to know the exact load on each tire. Even if your RV is within overall weight limits, a single tire may still be overloaded. This ensures correct tire inflation, prevents rapid tire failure, and extends tire life. Major tire manufacturers recommend weighing each wheel individually.</p>

<h2>Why should I have my RV weighed by RV Tech Weigh & Inspect?</h2>
<p>We follow industry-standard procedures, providing detailed reports comparing your RV's ratings with actual weights. We offer safety guidance, load balancing advice, and education. Our service helps you travel safely.</p>

<h2>How does the weighing process work?</h2>
<p>We like to have you provide information about your RV and tire pressures before we arrive at your appointment. At your appointment we use professional portable scales for each wheel. For motorhomes, we take readings and provide a detailed analysis. For towable combinations, we weigh the tow vehicle separately to determine pin or tongue weight.</p>

<h2>What if you can't weigh my RV at my campsite?</h2>
<p>Sometimes campsites are not level enough for accurate readings. We may have to move you to the street or a more level spot in your RV park.</p>

<h2>Why aren’t RVTWI scales "certified"?<h2>
<p>Certified scales are legal for trade, such as weighing goods for sale or ensuring compliance with Department of Transportation road limits. Certification involves significant costs and is not necessary for our purpose, which is to provide accurate weight information for safety and educational purposes. Our scales are calibrated annually and field-tested multiple times a year to ensure accuracy, even though they are not certified for trade.<p>

<h2>Can't I just use a truck stop scale?</h2>
<p>Truck scales may give total or axle weights, but they do not provide individual wheel weights. Without wheel-by-wheel data, you cannot ensure tires are loaded correctly. Using truck scales can also create inaccuracies, especially for tandem or multi-axle RVs.</p>

<h2>Are diagrams or online calculations reliable?</h2>
<p>Many online methods attempt to calculate wheel weights on truck scales or other platforms, but they are often inaccurate. These scales aren’t designed for individual wheel measurements, permission may be required, and many calculations are estimates rather than actual measurements.</p>

<h2>Is using a platform scale better than nothing?</h2>
<p>Overall weights on a platform scale can be a helpful starting point, but they don’t provide the precision and safety guidance that wheel-by-wheel weighing offers.</p>

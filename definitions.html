  <h1>RV Weight & Towing Definitions</h1>

<h2>GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating)</h2>
<p>
The maximum allowable weight of a fully loaded vehicle, including liquids, passengers,
cargo, and the tongue weight of any towed vehicle.
</p>

<h2>GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating)</h2>
<p>
The maximum allowable weight each axle assembly is designed to carry, as measured at the tires,
including the weight of the axle assembly itself.
</p>
<p>
GAWR is established by evaluating each axle component (tires, wheels, springs, axle) and rating
the axle based on its weakest component. Vehicle manufacturers often assume equal loading on
each side of the axle; however, this should not be assumed for RVs.
</p>
<p>
Because RVs are essentially homes on wheels, side-to-side weight imbalances are common.
Axle manufacturers generally consider an axle overloaded if the load on one side exceeds
half of the GAWR.
</p>

<h2>GCWR (Gross Combination Weight Rating)</h2>
<p>
The maximum allowable weight of a combination vehicle, including the fully loaded tow vehicle
and any attached towed vehicles such as trailers or towed cars.
</p>
<p>
GCWR assumes that the towed vehicle is equipped with functioning brakes, with some exceptions
for very light towed vehicles (typically under 1,500 pounds).
</p>

<h2>GTWR (Gross Trailer Weight Rating)</h2>
<p>
The maximum allowable towed vehicle weight for a hitch component. Each component of a ball-type
hitch (receiver, drawbar, ball, etc.) has its own rating.
</p>
<p>
Some hitch components have different ratings when used with a weight-distributing system.
This term is sometimes incorrectly substituted for trailer GVWR; GVWR is the more accurate
term when referring to the trailer manufacturer’s maximum allowable loaded trailer weight.
</p>

<h2>Tongue / Vertical Load Ratings</h2>
<p>
Also referred to as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tongue Weight Rating (TWR)</li>
  <li>Tongue Load Rating (TLR)</li>
  <li>Vertical Load Rating (VLR)</li>
  <li>Pin Weight Rating</li>
  <li>Vertical Weight Rating (VWR)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These terms describe the maximum allowable vertical load that can be carried by the hitch.
</p>

<h2>Tire Maximum Load</h2>
<p>
The maximum load capacity of a tire is molded into the tire sidewall, along with a corresponding
<strong>cold inflation pressure</strong>. Tires may also include a three-digit <strong>load index</strong>
that identifies the maximum load capacity.
</p>
<p>
Reducing tire inflation pressure reduces the tire’s load-carrying capacity. Tire manufacturers
and tire standards organizations publish load and inflation charts to establish safe load
capacities at various inflation pressures.
</p>

<h2>Weight and Load</h2>
<p>
These terms are often used interchangeably. In RV applications, vehicles have weight, which
imposes loads on tires, axles, and hitches.
</p>
<p>
Scale measurements represent loads carried by the tires. These measured loads are used to
calculate:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)</li>
  <li>Gross Axle Weight (GAW)</li>
  <li>Gross Combination Weight (GCW)</li>
  <li>Hitch Loads</li>
</ul>

<h2>UVW (Unloaded Vehicle Weight – Pre-2008 RVIA Definition)</h2>
<p>
The weight of a vehicle as built at the factory with full fuel, engine or generator oil,
and coolant. It does not include cargo, fresh water, LP gas, occupants, or dealer-installed
accessories.
</p>

<h2>UVW (Unloaded Vehicle Weight – Post-2008 Definition)</h2>
<p>
The weight of a vehicle as built at the factory with full fuel, operating fluids (oil,
coolants, washer fluid, etc.), and full propane containers.
</p>
<p>
This definition does <strong>not</strong> include the weight of a full fresh water tank.
</p>

<h2>RV Trailer CCC (Cargo Carrying Capacity)</h2>
<p>
The maximum weight of cargo that can be added to a towable RV before exceeding the GVWR.
Fresh water is considered cargo and must be subtracted from the CCC.
</p>
<p>
CCC is calculated by the manufacturer using the weight of the trailer as it left the factory,
including full propane containers.
</p>

<h2>Motorhome OCCC (Occupant and Cargo Carrying Capacity)</h2>
<p>
The maximum combined weight of occupants and cargo that can be added to a motorized RV
before exceeding the GVWR.
</p>
<p>
Passenger weight, cargo, fresh water, and trailer tongue weight are all considered cargo
and must be subtracted from the OCCC.
</p>

<h2>NCC (Net Carrying Capacity – Pre-2008 RVIA Definition)</h2>
<p>
The maximum weight of all personal belongings, food, fresh water, LP gas, tools,
dealer-installed accessories, and other cargo that can be carried by the RV.
</p>

<h2>SCWR (Sleeping Capacity Weight Rating – Pre-2008 RVIA Definition)</h2>
<p>
Calculated as the manufacturer-designated number of sleeping positions multiplied by
154 pounds (70 kilograms).
</p>

<h2>Common Liquid Weights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Water: 8.3 lbs per gallon</li>
  <li>Diesel Fuel: 6.8 lbs per gallon</li>
  <li>Gasoline: 5.6 lbs per gallon</li>
  <li>Propane: 4.2 lbs per gallon</li>
</ul>
